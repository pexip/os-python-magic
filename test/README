There are a few ways to run the python-magic tests

 1. `pytest` will run the test suite against your default version of python
 2. `./test/run_all_versions.py` will run the tests against all installed versions of python.
 3. `./test/run_all_docker_test.sh` will run against a variety of different Linux distributions, using docker.
